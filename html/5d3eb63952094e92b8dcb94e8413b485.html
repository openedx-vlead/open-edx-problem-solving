<p>In this experiment we introduce you to two very famous algorithmic problems.One problem is longest continuous decreasing subsequence problem and other one is longest increasing subsequence problem.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Problem 1:</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Given a list of n distinct numbers (where n &lt;= 1000), find the length of the longest monotone decreasing subsequence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Definition : A monotone decreasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers (contiguously placed in the list) which are strictly decreasing from left to right. For example, if we have the series &rdquo;2 1 9 8 10 7 5 4 3 1 10&rdquo;, then the subsequence &rdquo;10 7 5 4 3 1&rdquo; is contiguously arranged and monotonically decreasing. Thus, the answer to be printed out for the length of &rdquo;10 7 5 4 3 1&rdquo; which is 6. Note that the sequence &rdquo;9 8 7 5 4 3 1&rdquo; is not a subsequence we are looking for as the numbers are not contiguous placed in the list.</p>

<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input will contain some positive integers separated by spaces. The number of integers is not specified and the input will be terminated by end of file. Each integer is &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup> and the length of the input sequence is &lt;= 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Print the length of the longest continuous decreasing subsequence.</p>

<p><b>Sample Input and Output</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input: 2 1 9 8 10 7 5 4 3 1 10 <br /> Output:6<br /> Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br /> Output: 1</p>

<h2><strong>Problem 2:</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Given a set of n distinct numbers, find the length of the longest monotone increasing subsequence. Note that the sequence need not be continuous(Refer: Section 4.7 of Dromey).</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input will contain two lines. The first line contains the number of integers in the sequence, N(&lt;=1000) and the next line contains N positive integers (each &lt;=10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the given input sequence.</p>

<p><b>Sample Input and Output</b></p>
<p><br /> Input: 10<br /> 1 2 9 4 7 3 11 8 14 6<br /> Output:6<br /> Input: 6 <br /> 1 3 2 10 4 5<br /> Output: 4</p>
