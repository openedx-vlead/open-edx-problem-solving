<p>String is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and/or the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as a byte (or word) array that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. A string may also denote more general array data types and/or other sequential data types and structures; terms such as byte string, or more general, string of datatype, or datatype-string, are sometimes used to denote strings in which the stored data does not(necessarily) represent text.</p>
<h2>Problem 1:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A palindrome is a symmetric character sequence that looks the same when read backwards, i.e. from right to left. Interestingly, human being usually discards blank spaces and punctuation marks while recognizing a palindromes like: (a) &ldquo;Madam, I&rsquo;m Adam.&rdquo; (b) &ldquo;Eve.&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Write a program that detects palindromes. Your program should accept a string from the key board and output YES/NO.</p>

<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input will contain a string S entered from keyboard, with number of characters less than 1000.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Output must be either "YES" or "NO"(quotes for clarity) depending upon whether or not it is a palindrome.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Sample Input and Output</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input: Madam, I'm Adam<br /> Output:YES<br /> Input: Eve.<br /> Output: NO</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Problem 2:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Given two strings, PRINT (YES or NO) whether the second string can be obtained from the first by deletion of none, one or more characters.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input will contain two strings separated by a space and size of each string is at max 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Output must be either "YES" or "NO" depending on whether 2<sup>nd </sup>string can be obtained from 1<sup>st </sup>string.</p>
<p></p>
