<p>Welcome to recursion. One of the most easiest things to code but really hard to debug! Recursion is a very powerful tool to solve problems. All loops(while, for , do while) can be simulated using recursion. Also the main step of the dynamic programming is recursion which is useful in solving many algorithmically difficult problems. Lets solve some problems now.</p>
<h2>Problem 1:</h2>
<p>You are given scales for weighing loads. On the left side lies a single stone of known weight W &lt; 2N. You own a set of N different weights, weighing 1, 2, 4, ..., 2<sup>N</sup>&minus;1 units of mass respectively. Determine how many possible ways there are of placing some weights on the sides of the scales, so as to balance them (put them in a state of equilibrium).</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The input line contains two integers: N W, where N denotes the number of weights and W represents the weight to be placed on the left side.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Output must be a single integer denoting the number ways in which one can balance the weight W by placing weights on any side.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Sample Input and Output</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input: 2 4<br /> Output: 3 <br /> Input: 5 10<br /> Output: 14 </p>
<p></p>

<h2>Problem 2:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Given a weighing pan, n weights and a destination weight D, print &ldquo;YES&rdquo; or &ldquo;NO&rdquo; depending whether you can weight D using other weights given.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Input begins with numbers of weights n, then n values denoting mass of each weight and then in the end destination weight D.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Output Specification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>As the output, print &ldquo;YES&rdquo; if it is possible to weight D, otherwise &ldquo;NO&rdquo;.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p><b>Sample Input and Output</b></p>
<p><br /> Input: 3 1 3 4 2<br /> Output: YES<br /> Input: 2 1 3 5 <br /> Output: NO</p>
